This website was built in Flask. The data for the resume
items is stored in a CockroachDB cluster.

Then it was containerized and made deployable using Docker
and Kubernetes



Soon the frontend will be redone in Angular

After that a Terraform configuration will be made

Then finally the whole deployment process will be set
off every time I push new changes to the remote repo
thanks to Jenkins

I will then be using tools such as Prometheus and
Graphana to learn how to monitor the health of my
website
