To whom it may concern,

	Hello, my name is Dylan. I was a student at 42 Silicon Valley until the school unfortunately went under due to covid. When I started at the school, I had no coding experience and minimal linux experience, having only installed and explored Ubuntu on an old laptop. Through the rigorous entries process, the excellent community at the school, and my own tenacity I was able to set up a fully functioning Arch Linux machine that I was able to study and practice coding and scripting on as well as learning the deeper intricacies of the Linux architecture, entirely through the lens of the commandline interface. As of now I have 4 years of personal experience working with the intricacies of Linux, scripting in Bash, and coding in C and C++. I also gained an understanding of Docker, containerization in general, and some basic networking skills. Since the school's closure, I've begun studying Python and learning common tools such as Kubernetes and Terraform while continuing to deepen my understanding of Unix based systems and the intricacies of writing code for them in C and C++. I also spent 6 months as a fullstack web developer where I got to further tailor my linux development environment to mesh with the professional workflow in that role. I feel that this opportunity would be excellent for me to sharpen these skills and would be excellent for you as you would gain a tenacious worker who wants to do whatever it takes to learn and continually improve my skillset, delivering continually higher quality work in an increasingly efficient fashion.

Thank you for you time and consideration,
Dylan Romansky
