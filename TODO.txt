Develop frontend in Angular instead of using Flask for everything
-Decide what other pages I might want as part of my site
-https://auth0.com/blog/using-python-flask-and-angular-to-build-modern-apps-part-1/

Rework file structure
-split classes, config, backend into their own files

Automate cockroachdb initialization
-Cockroach needs client/server keys to authenticate when secure

Write all secrets in a file called .env and have it read from those


Migrate from docker-compose.yml to kubernetes manifest
-Look at load balancers
--Due to its order of operations, the PostgreSQL wire protocol's
  implementation of TLS is not compatible with SNI-based routing
  in the Kubernetes ingress controller. Instead, use a TCP load
  balancer for CockroachDB that is not shared with other services.
-Due to cockroachdb's tendency to kill nodes that are out of sync
 by 500ms+, sync all nodes to time.google.com
-Do I need to attach a cockroachdb instance to every instance of
 my frontend or is it enough to have a set of cockroachdb pods
 and point my backend pods to the cockroachdb pods

Integrate into Terraform for scaling purposes

Set up Jenkins, Github Actions, or similar to create my CI/CD pipeline

Look at how Graphana, Prometheus, and similar are used to monitor site health
