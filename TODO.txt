Develop frontend in Angular instead of using Flask for everything
-Decide what other pages I might want as part of my site

Rework file structure
-split classes, config, backend into their own files

Move from MySQL to a more cluster centered db (CockroachDB)
-write a docker-compose.yml to make it all work together
--look over the docker-compose documentation to find ways to hide secrets
---Cockroach needs client/server keys to authenticate

---environment variables: "DATABASE_URL"
---Flask can populate from files on your machine

Convert from sql queries and response parsing to ORM
-sqlalchemy and psycopg3

look at loadbalancers

Migrate from docker-compose.yml to kubernetes manifest

Integrate into Terraform for scaling purposes

Set up Jenkins, Github Actions, or similar to create my CI/CD pipeline

Look at how Graphana, Prometheus, and similar are used to monitor site health
