This website was built in Flask. The data for the resume
items is stored in a SQL database
--TODO: make frontend with Angular

Then it was containerized and deployed using Docker,
Kubernetes, and Terraform

Finally the whole deployment process is set off every
time I push new changes to the remote repo thanks to
Jenkins or Github Actions depending on which I settle on

I will then be using tools such as Prometheus and
Graphana to learn how to monitor the health of my
website
